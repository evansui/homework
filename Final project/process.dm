Process: 
At the very beginning, I tried to use some RGB LEDs to achieve my goal. However, based on my research, I didn’t find some perfect lights because I need a lot of them to have enough brightness. Then I thought LED strip might be a good choice because it’s bright enough and has different colors. 
The most complicated part is how to write my code. My light has one temperature sensor, one light sensor, one real-time module and one switch. At first, I found a temperature sensor code and a light sensor code online and rewrote them. They worked well separately at that time. However, when I combined them together, the number from the temperature sensor was not stable and it was influenced by the light sensor. I thought this might be a problem of the code and check it many times. Finally, I found there was something wrong with the breadboard. Although it was easy to solve this problem, it took me a long time to figure out what the problem is. After that, I added a real-time module code. For that time, I rewrote my code many times because I wanted to figure out the whole working process of this light. It has several different input parts and they need to work in a proper order. 
After that, originally I wanted to add a sound sensor to make my light more interesting, but someone in our class used the same idea. Then I changed it to a switch because I thought sometimes users just need a normal light. This switch can convert the light between two different modes of operation. 
The next step is about testing. When I used an extra power, the number from the temperature sensor was not stable and I didn’t know why. I asked help from Michael and he told me this might be a problem about the same ground pin. This light has four different modules and they will influence each other when they connect the same ground pin. I separated them into two ground pins and solved this problem.
Finally, I wanted to use a shield to make my circuit cleaner, but I found there was no need to do this because of the most part of my circuit wires. Then I made a wood box for it to made it looks beautiful. This was a memorable experience and I achieved my original goal of this soothe light.
